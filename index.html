			<h1>Local Woman Wins Marathon</h1>
			<img src="blake.jpg" style=""/>

			<p>Park City native Laura Blake won the 27th Front
				Range Marathon over an elite field of the best
				long-distance runners in the country. Laura's
				time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. was only 2 minutes
				off the women's course record set last year by
				Sarah Rawlings. Kathy Lasker and Lisa Peterson
				finished second and third, respectively. Laura's
				victory came on the heels of her performance at
				the NCAA Track and Field Championships, in which
				she placed second running for Colorado State.
				</P>

			<p>In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio,
				Texas, used a finishing kick to win the men's
				marathon for the second straight year, in a time
				of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the race,
				Kyle Wills of Billings, Montana, finished second when
				he could not match Teagan's finishing pace. Jason Wu of
				Cutler, Colorado, placed third in a very competitive field.</p>

			<p>This year's race through downtown Boulder boasted
				the largest field in the marathon's history, with
				over 9500 men and 6700 women competing. Race
				conditions were perfect with low humidity and
				temperatures that never exceeded 85 degrees.</p>

			<h3>Highway 6 Reopens</h3>

			<p>Highway 6 will reopen this Friday, May 3rd, after a
				final safety inspection. A late blizzard delayed road
				crews, marking this as one of the latest dates on
				record for the highway's reopening.</p>

			<p>Rising to an elevation of 12,351 feet at Grace Pass,
				Highway 6 is a main link between Park City and Lake Elton.
				The reopening of the road is one of the annual signs that
				summer is near and the tourist season will soon be upon us!</p>

			<h3>Cougar Sightings Increase</h3>

				<h4>If You Encounter a Cougar</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>Stop, stand tall, and don't run. A cougar's instinct is to chase.</li>
					<li>Try to appear larger than the cougar by raising your arms.</li>
					<li>Back away slowly, always keeping eye contact.</li>
					<li>If the cougar displays aggressive behavior, shout and wave your arms.
						Convince the cougar that you are not prey, but a potential danger.</li>
					<li>In case of an attack, stay on your feet and fight back aggressively. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			 <div class="cougardetails">
			<p>Cougar sightings have increased 40% in the Park City area
				according to a report released yesterday by the state DNR.
				In the last month alone, there were ten sightings in Park City
				and the surrounding communities of Riley and Dixon. This compares
				to only twelve sightings for the entire spring of last year.</p>

			<p>Reasons for the growing number of cougar sightings include
				increasing encroachment by people into former wildlife habitats
				and new wildlife regulations that result in decreasing numbers of
				elk and deer being taken by hunters. Cougars may be wandering into
				developed areas, following the herds.</p>

			<p>DNR spokesman Steve Tasker asks residents to call the DNR
				report line at 555-6981 if they believe they have seen a cougar
				or any large predatory animal. Two fatalities have already
				occurred in the west this year from cougar attacks.</p>
